## Concrete Strength ML Project

### Features:

- *1. cement:* The amount of cement used in the mix (in kg per cubic meter). Cement is a primary binder in concrete and contributes significantly to its strength.
- *2. blast_furnace_slag:* The amount of blast furnace slag (in kg per cubic meter). Slag is a byproduct of iron production and is often used as a cement substitute to enhance durability and reduce costs.
- *3.fly_ash:* The amount of fly ash (in kg per cubic meter). Fly ash is another industrial byproduct used as a supplementary cementitious material.
- *4. water:* The amount of water (in kg per cubic meter). Water content is crucial for the hydration of cement and influences the workability and strength of concrete.
superplasticizer: The amount of superplasticizer (in kg per cubic meter). These are chemical additives that improve workability without increasing water content.
- *5. coarse_aggregate:* The amount of coarse aggregate (in kg per cubic meter). These are larger particles (e.g., gravel) that form the bulk of the concrete mix.
- *6. fine_aggregate:* The amount of fine aggregate (in kg per cubic meter). These are smaller particles (e.g., sand) that fill gaps between coarse aggregates.
- *7. age:* The age of the concrete (in days) when the compressive strength was measured. Concrete strength typically increases with age due to ongoing hydration.
- *`8. concrete_compressive_strength:`* The target variable (in MPa), representing the compressive strength of the concrete. This is the key output used to evaluate the quality of the concrete mix.
