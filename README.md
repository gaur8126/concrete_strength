# Concrete Strength ML Project

## Features:

* #### *`cement:`* The amount of cement used in the mix (in kg per cubic meter). Cement is a primary binder in concrete and contributes significantly to its strength.

* #### *`blast_furnace_slag:`* The amount of blast furnace slag (in kg per cubic meter). Slag is a byproduct of iron production and is often used as a cement substitute to enhance durability and reduce costs.

* #### *`fly_ash:`* The amount of fly ash (in kg per cubic meter). Fly ash is another industrial byproduct used as a supplementary cementitious material.

* #### *`water:`* The amount of water (in kg per cubic meter). Water content is crucial for the hydration of cement and influences the workability and strength of concrete.

* #### *`superplasticizer:`* The amount of superplasticizer (in kg per cubic meter). These are chemical additives that improve workability without increasing water content.

* #### *`coarse_aggregate:`* The amount of coarse aggregate (in kg per cubic meter). These are larger particles (e.g., gravel) that form the bulk of the concrete mix.

* #### *`fine_aggregate:`* The amount of fine aggregate (in kg per cubic meter). These are smaller particles (e.g., sand) that fill gaps between coarse aggregates.

* #### *`age:`* The age of the concrete (in days) when the compressive strength was measured. Concrete strength typically increases with age due to ongoing hydration. 

* #### *`concrete_compressive_strength:`* The target variable (in MPa), representing the compressive strength of the concrete. This is the key output used to evaluate the quality of the concrete mix.
